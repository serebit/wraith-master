## Contributing

Hi! If you're looking at this file, that likely means that you want to contribute to Wraith Master. If so, there's a couple things you should keep in mind.

### Be Respectful

I'm not going to include an entire code of conduct, because I don't believe it's necessary. Just be chill and respectful.

### Issue Policy

If there's something you'd like to see in Wraith Master, create an issue for it! I'd love to hear ideas for what could be added or changed, and I'll likely toss up a reply to the issue within a day or two. Keep in mind, though, that I'm not planning on adding anything major beyond what the official Cooler Master application is capable of.

In addition, if you find a bug with Wraith Master, create an issue with it with as much detail as you find appropriate. If I think it's within scope and it's an issue with the software itself, I'll try my best to resolve it.

### Merge Request Policy

Merge requests for bug fixes shouldn't take too long to review, and are likely to be merged if they're within scope. Merge requests for features *should have an issue created first*, so the feature can be discussed before being implemented.

### And that's it!

Thanks for reading! Have an awesome day.
