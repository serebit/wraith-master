## Unreleased - 1.2.0-dev

#### Changed 
- Switch from libusb to HIDAPI. This makes the startup time of the GTK frontend, and the execution time of the CLI frontend, about 5x faster. Requires an update of your installed udev rules if you installed Wraith Master manuallyâ€”if you installed via a distro package (`deb`, `rpm`, AUR, Solus, etc), this update to the udev rules will be performed automatically. 
- Switch to the experimental mimalloc allocator for Kotlin object allocation, which slightly improves runtime performance and memory usage

#### Fixed
- Updated .desktop file with accurate categories and a TryExec field

#### Meta 
- Update Kotlin to 1.4.10
- Update Gradle wrapper to 6.6.1


## 1.1.0 (2020-08-09)

#### Added 
- Firmware version reporting
- Resetting to default profile
- Toggle for Enso mode
- Focus clears on pressing the escape button

#### Changed 
- More padding in GTK, since it felt a bit cramped to some people

#### Fixed 
- More precise finding of `version.txt`, allowing version detection if the `installdir` is set to something other than `/usr` or `/usr/local`
- Clear focus on click in the About dialog box
- Prevent potentially weird behavior or crashing with better memory management
- [#10](https://gitlab.com/serebit/wraith-master/-/issues/10) - Remove "plugdev" group requirement to resolve udev error on Fedora

#### Meta 
- Remove `taskTree` gradle plugin, as it is no longer needed
- Fix valgrind tasks
- Update Kotlin to 1.4.0-rc
- Update Gradle to 6.6-rc-6
- Add Gradle properties `forceudev`, `installmode`, and `packageroot` (see the wiki for more details on these properties)


## 1.0.0 (2020-05-10)

#### Added 
- **Mirage frequency control**, the last major feature that required implementation
- "About" dialog in GTK, viewable by clicking the info button in the title bar
- `version` option in CLI
- Dialog box in GTK upon attempting to exit with unsaved changes

#### Changed 
- Increased width of morse textbox in GTK
- Made overall GTK design more compact
- In GTK, the Reset button no longer power-cycles the device
- In GTK: the Save, Reset, and morse's Apply buttons now change their sensitivity based on whether the current values are the same as the saved values
- In GTK, saved settings are restored both on app close and on app start
- In GTK, reordered component tabs to reflect Cooler Master application

#### Removed 
- Brightness setting for the ring component's Morse mode is no longer available. Even though the Cooler Master application does show support for it, the setting doesn't affect the actual ring brightness

#### Fixed 
- Reset button no longer segfaults after a few presses

#### Meta 
- Update Kotlin to 1.4-M1 (retains 1.3.7x build compatibility for Solus)
- Update Gradle to 6.4
- Code cleanup in GTK and core, with a focus on reducing total LoC without sacrificing looks or functionality
- `distTar` Gradle task now produces a tarball with correct permissions
- Added `strip` property to `package` Gradle task, which strips packaged binaries if enabled


## 0.5.2 (2020-03-16)

#### Fixed 
- Reset button causing segfault


## 0.5.1 (2020-03-13)

#### Added 
- `verbose` flag to show program status in CLI frontend

#### Fixed 
- Color button in GTK frontend no longer stays sensitive to input on mode change or startup when color randomization is enabled
- Reset button in GTK frontend updates widgets to the device's saved values
- Significantly reduced number of transfers to device in CLI frontend
- Significantly more checks to ensure parameter validity in CLI frontend
- Eliminated (tiny) memory leaks in setup caused by unfreed libusb resources

#### Meta 
- Updated Kotlin to 1.3.70
- Reduced code complexity and duplication


## 0.5.0 (2020-03-01)

#### Added 
- **Morse text setting**, which can parse plaintext along with literal morse code
- Randomized color option for supported modes

#### Changed 
- Changed "Direction" label to "Rotation Direction" for clarity
- Adjusted padding of main settings box

#### Fixed 
- Modified style to be more consistent across GTK themes while maintaining that theme's look and feel

- Fixed crash on swapping ring mode to a mode that supports both random colors and rotation direction if the random colors option was selected for that mode outside of Wraith Master
- Clicking on the window now clears the keyboard focus
- Color buttons now have the correct colors set on startup for modes that don't support color

#### Meta
- Updated Kotlin to 1.3.70-eap-3

- Informational dialog box when attempting to open a new Wraith Master window while one already exists

## 0.4.1 (2020-01-13)

#### Changed 
- In both frontends, restore a mode's previous settings (color, speed, brightness, etc) when that mode is selected

#### Fixed 
- Regression in GTK frontend where a failure in resolving the Wraith device would crash the program instead of providing the error message

#### Added 
- Mirage toggle for fan
- `noudev` Gradle property to disable automatic installation of udev rules
- Better error handling on opening USB device for transfers

- Creating additional broken "remote instance" windows is no longer allowed
- Both frontends no longer require `sudo` to run on systems that use `udev` or `eudev`
- Compilation now works on Debian without modification. Alpine is pending a fix for [this issue](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/3771)


## 0.3.1 (2020-01-13)

#### Fixed 
- Both frontends no longer require `sudo` to run on systems that use `systemd`


## 0.3.0 (2020-01-13)

#### Added 
- Error dialog for when a Wraith Prism USB device can't be found
- Direction control for ring modes that support it
- New page-based layout for GTK frontend
- Certain controls in the GTK frontend become inactive when a mode that doesn't support them is selected

- Resources are now properly closed on program exit, on both the GTK frontend and libusb frontend
