Wraith Master is a feature-complete graphical and command-line application for controlling the RGB LEDs on AMD's Wraith
stock coolers. At the moment, the only supported cooler is the Wraith Prism, but there are plans to add other Wraith
coolers as well. It exists as an independent companion to [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/), and is designed to provide
control over all functionality exposed by the hardware. In summary: it's **lightweight**, it's **native**, it's
**fast**, it's **complete**, and it's **self-contained.**

## Installing

![Packaging Status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/wraith-master.svg)

### Debian, Ubuntu, Mint

Prebuilt `.deb` packages are available on the Releases page on both GitLab and GitHub.

### Red Hat, Fedora

Prebuilt `.rpm` packages are available on the Releases page on both GitLab and GitHub.

### Arch Linux

[![AUR package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/aur/wraith-master.svg)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?K=wraith%2Dmaster)

If you're on Arch Linux or one of its derivatives, you can install both frontends from the AUR. If you'd rather not
build from source, you'll want to install `wraith-master-bin`; otherwise, it's under `wraith-master-cli` for the CLI
frontend and `wraith-master-gtk` for the GTK frontend.

### Solus

[![Solus package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/solus/wraith-master.svg)](https://packages.getsol.us/shannon/w/wraith-master/)

Solus has both frontends in the official repository. They can be installed either by
running `sudo eopkg install wraith-master` in the terminal, or searching for the package in the Software Center.

### Other Distributions

There are precompiled binaries available for each release [here](https://gitlab.com/serebit/wraith-master/-/releases),
with all binaries and resources included.

## Runtime Dependencies

These dependencies only need to be manually installed if you either built the software yourself, or are using a
standalone binary rather than a distribution package (which would prompt these dependencies to install).
