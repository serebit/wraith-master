    <summary>GUI and command-line utility for controlling the RGB LEDs on AMD Wraith CPU coolers</summary>
    <description>
        <p>
            Wraith Master is a lightweight application for controlling the RGB LEDs on AMD's Wraith stock coolers. At
            the moment, the only supported cooler is the Wraith Prism, but there are plans to add other Wraith coolers
            as well. Both a command line interface and a graphical interface are provided.
